# SHINY POKEDEX
The Shiny Pokedex is a web application that provides information about shiny versions of Pokemon, including their type and description.
Each Pokemon entry includes details such as its name, type, and a brief description. Users can also view a high-resolution image of the shiny Pokemon to get a better visual representation.

With the Shiny Pokedex, users can easily access information about shiny Pokemon and enhance their knowledge and understanding of these rare and unique variations. Whether you're a seasoned Pokemon trainer or just starting your shiny Pokemon collection, this application is a valuable tool for all Pokemon enthusiasts.

## Introduction

As a passionate Pokemon enthusiast, I have always been fascinated by the world of shiny Pokemon. Their unique colors and rare appearances make them highly sought after by trainers. That's why I created the Shiny Pokedex web application. I wanted to provide a platform where fellow Pokemon lovers can easily access information about shiny Pokemon and enhance their knowledge and understanding of these rare variations.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the website.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements and the guided tour using Shepherd.js and accessing the the data through pokeapi.
- **Shepherd.js (included via CDN)**: For creating the guided tour.

## Features
- **Home Page**: A single-page application that displays shiny versions of Pokemon.
- **Picture**: High-resolution images of shiny Pokemon are shown to the user.
- **Description**: Detailed information about each Pokemon, including its name, type, and a brief description.
- **Region Selector**: Users can select a specific region (e.g., Kanto, Hoenn) to view Pokemon from that region.
- **Guided Tour**: An interactive tour that guides visitors through the features of the application.
